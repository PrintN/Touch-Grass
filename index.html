        <p>"Touch grass" is not an insult towards gamers; rather, it is advice for them. When participating in intense periods of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty. The sweat causes the hand to become slick, making it more difficult to retain a grip on the gamer's gaming mouse and, thus, more challenging to perform well in intense gaming moments. By touching grass with the gamer's hand, the grass will impart a layer of particulate onto the gamer's hand, which can consist of a variety of dust, dirt, and other natural matter. This particulate will then act in a similar way to climbers chalk, absorbing the sweat and drying out the gamer's hand. With dry hands, the gamer can now perform to their maximum potential when gaming. This is why when an enemy or teammate tells you to touch grass, they are simply trying to assist you in performing better. That's why this extension was made to help you perform better in your intense gaming sessions</p>
